Task 1: Blog

This is a sample and very basic layout of the blog template as requested by Mr. Nitesh Kuchhal, Co-Founder | Visionary Monks Educational Solutions Pvt. Ltd
This is an early preview of what the blog will look like and we can carry on from there. 

Things to be noted (pretty basic but elegant)-
1. Round edges on header and blog templates.
2. Translucent captions and header.
3. Simplicity and style
